Congrats, you like words! so here you get some more.

I'm a young engineer in the field of Cyber Security that blogs about things while I learn them, or because I wish to share my thoughts and insights. My opinions are my own, and so will it allways be. I will most likely change my mind on stuff that have been written, but thats the charm about learning. Hopefully that wont happen to often, but when it do I will do my best to add a note about it.
